      <p class="">
        After a career of promoting other people's creations I am branching out
        as a web developer to create and promote some of my own. I am currently
        in the Thinkful Engineering Immersion Bootcamp to help fulfill this
        goal. I've always been too curious for my own good and now I'm using my
        skills for four main purposes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Compose code and apps to make new things work.</li>
        <li>Optimize current apps to make good things work better.</li>
        <li>Develop new 'toys' to help accomplish the first two goals</li>
        <li>
          Experience the world both inside and outside of the computer screen.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
